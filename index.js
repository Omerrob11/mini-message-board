// routes for users, for example
// folder for the routers
// we don't want to work with the data here
// we import the controller
// and use those function as handlers to our http methods

// models:
// where is the database most of the time.

// controllers:
// execute what you want to do with the data - manage it
// we write the function that do stuff with the data
// then export it

// views:
//client side - frontend
